Mounts are only available at run and deploy times, you must redeploy (restart) an app to mount or unmount to an existing app's container.

See the process scaling documentation for more information. dokku ps:rebuild app-name A more complete workflow may require making a custom directory for your application and mounting it within your /app/storage directory instead.

For example: dokku storage:report node-js-app --storage-deploy-mounts Use Cases Persistent storage Dokku is powered by Docker containers, which recommends in their best practices that containers be treated as ephemeral. In order to manage persistent storage for web applications, like user uploads or large binary assets like images, a directory outside the container should be mounted. Shared storage between containers When scaling your app, you may require a common location to access shared assets between containers, a storage mount can be used in this situation. Shared storage across environments Your app may be used in a cluster that requires containers or resources not running on the same host access your data. Mounting a shared file service (like S3FS or EFS) inside your container will give you great flexibility. Backing up Your app may have services that are running in memory and need to be backed up locally (like a key store). Mount a non ephemeral storage mount will allow backups that are not lost when the app is shut down. Build phase By default, Dokku will only bind storage mounts during the deploy and run phases. Under certain conditions, one might want to bind a storage mount during the build phase. This can be accomplished by using the docker-options plugin directly. dokku docker-options:add <app> build \"-v /tmp/python-test:/opt/test\" You cannot use mounted volumes during the build phase of a Dockerfile deploy. This is because Docker does not support volumes when executing docker build . Note This can cause data loss if you bind a mount under /app in buildpack apps as herokuish will attempt to remove the original app path during the build phase. Application User and Persistent Storage file ownership (buildpack apps only) New Introduced in 0.7.1 By default, Dokku will execute your buildpack application processes as the herokuishuser user. You may override this by setting the DOKKU_APP_USER config variable. Info NOTE: this user must exist in your herokuish image.

Dokku 0.6.0 introduced the ability to map host ports to specific container ports. In the future this will allow other proxy software - such as HAProxy or Caddy - to be used in place of nginx. Usage Container network interface binding New Introduced in 0.5.0 By default, the deployed docker container running your app's web process will bind to the internal docker network interface (i.e. docker inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' $CONTAINER_ID ). This behavior can be modified per app by disabling the proxy (i.e. dokku proxy:disable <app> ). In this case, the container will bind to an external interface (i.e. 0.0.0.0 ) and your app container will be directly accessible by other hosts on your network. Info If a proxy is disabled, Dokku will bind your container's port to a random port on the host for every deploy, e.g. 0.0.0.0:32771->5000/tcp . By way of example, in the default case, each container is bound to the docker interface: Shell Output docker ps CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 1b88d8aec3d1 dokku/node-js-app:latest \"/bin/bash -c '/star About a minute ago Up About a minute node-js-app.web.1 As such, the container's IP address will be an internal IP, and thus it is only accessible on the host itself: docker inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' node-js-app.web.1 172.17.0.6 However, you can disable the internal proxying via the proxy:disable command so that it will listen on the host's IP address: Shell Output dokku proxy:disable node-js-app # container bound to all interfaces docker ps CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES d6499edb0edb dokku/node-js-app:latest \"/bin/bash -c '/star About a minute ago Up About a minute 0.0.0.0:49153->5000/tcp node-js-app.web.1 Displaying proxy reports about an app New Introduced in 0.8.1 You can get a report about the app's proxy status using the proxy:report command: Shell Output dokku proxy:report =====> node-js-app proxy information Proxy enabled: true Proxy type: nginx Proxy port map: http:80:5000 https:443:5000 =====> python-sample proxy information Proxy enabled: true Proxy type: nginx Proxy port map: http:80:5000 =====> ruby-sample proxy information Proxy enabled: true Proxy type: nginx Proxy port map: http:80:5000 You can run the command for a specific app also.

For example: dokku proxy:report node-js-app --proxy-type Proxy port mapping New Introduced in 0.6.0 You can now configure host -> container port mappings with the proxy:ports-* commands. This mapping is currently supported by the built-in nginx-vhosts plugin. To inspect the port mapping for a given application, use the proxy:ports command: Shell Output dokku proxy:ports node-js-app -----> Port mappings for node-js-app -----> scheme host port container port http 80 5000 The above application is listening on the host's port 80 , which we can test via curl: Shell Output curl http://node-js-app.dokku.me Hello World!

You can also remove a port mapping that is no longer necessary: dokku proxy:ports-remove node-js-app http:80:5000 By default, buildpack apps and dockerfile apps without explicitly exposed ports (i.e. using the EXPOSE directive) will be configured with a listener on port 80 (and additionally a listener on 443 if ssl is enabled) that will proxy to the application container on port 5000 . Dockerfile apps with explicitly exposed ports will be configured with a listener on each exposed port and will proxy to that same port of the deployed application container. Note This default behavior will not be automatically changed on subsequent pushes and must be manipulated with the proxy:ports-* syntax detailed above. Proxy Port Scheme The proxy port scheme is as follows: SCHEME:HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT The scheme metadata can be used by proxy implementations in order to properly handle proxying of requests. For example, the built-in nginx-vhosts proxy implementation supports both the http and https schemes. Developers of proxy implementations are encouraged to use whatever schemes make the most sense, and ignore configurations which they do not support. For instance, a udp proxy implementation can safely ignore http and https port mappings.

DNS Versions There are many different DNS servers 'in the wild'. Some of the popular ones on Linux are BIND, dnsmasq, and pdns. Windows has its own built-in DNS server as well as Unbound, Posadis, and more. A full list of DNS packages can be found on Wikipedia under Comparison of DNS Server Software . In addition to the various DNS packages, there are tens of thousands of Managed DNS Providers out that all have different DNS interfaces. Focus Because there are so many different DNS server packages out there as well as a tremendous number of Managed DNS Providers, we will focus on the concepts of DNS as well as providing examples in the 'BIND' format so you can adapt the information to your own server package or managed DNS provider. Assumptions We assume you have a passing familiarity with DNS. If not, you can read an in-depth article on DNS. But basically you need to know that DNS changes names (like example.tld) into addresses (like 127.0.0.1) We assume you already have a domain name registered and pointed to your favorite Managed DNS Provider or have your own BIND DNS server running. You have a server on the internet and are about to follow the instructions in the README to get Dokku installed. Don't do the install just yet though. Caching Please remember that DNS relies heavily on caching . Changes you make to DNS could take anywhere from a few seconds to a few days to propagate. If you tried surfing to example.tld, then changed the IP address in DNS, it could be a while before your computer picks up on the changes. HELP! Don't be afraid to ask if you need help. Create a new issue and someone will be glad to assist you. Getting started For the examples, we will use the domain name example.tld and the IP address 127.0.0.1 . Dokku uses DNS to differentiate between apps on your dokku-powered server. If you are using the domain example.tld , and you have two apps myapp1 and myapp2 , Dokku will make them available at myapp1.example.tld and myapp2.example.tld . To get started, you need to know the IP address of your Dokku server. Connect to it and run ifconfig or ip addr to see the IP address. Now you have to make a decision about your domain. Do you want everything and anything at example.tld to go to your Dokku server, or would you rather use a 'sub domain' for your Dokku server? In other words, do you want your applications on your Dokku server accessible via myapp.example.tld or via myapp.myserver.example.tld ? Using a sub-domain (myapp.myserver.example.tld) Using a sub-domain is easy. When you set up your server, you probably gave it a name like myserver.example.tld . Go in to your Managed DNS provider and create an A record named myserver and put in the IP address you got from your server a few moments ago. Hopefully your managed DNS provider also supports wildcards. Create a second A record named *.myserver along with the IP address you got from your server a few moments ago. If you are using BIND, your zone file will look similar to this: $ORIGIN example.tld $TTL 5m myserver IN A 127.0.0.1 *.myserver IN A 127.0.0.1 You can verify your changes in Linux by trying one or more of the following commands: host myserver.example.tld dig -t A myserver.example.tld nslookup myserver.example.tld Now is a good time to remind you that the answers you get MAY BE CACHED.

Please refer to the proxy documentation for information as to how to reconfigure the mappings. Customizing hostnames Applications typically have the following structure for their hostname: scheme://subdomain.domain.tld The subdomain is inferred from the pushed application name, while the domain.tld is set during initial configuration and stored in the $DOKKU_ROOT/VHOST file. It can then be modified with dokku domains:add-global and dokku domains:remove-global . This value is used as a default TLD for all applications on a host.

The application will therefore be deployed at subdomain.domain.tld.domain.tld . You can optionally override this in a plugin by implementing the nginx-hostname plugin trigger. For example, you can reverse the subdomain with the following sample nginx-hostname plugin trigger: #!/usr/bin/env bash set -eo pipefail ; [[ $DOKKU_TRACE ]] && set -x APP = \" $1 \" ; SUBDOMAIN = \" $2 \" ; VHOST = \" $3 \" NEW_SUBDOMAIN = ` echo $SUBDOMAIN | rev ` echo \" $NEW_SUBDOMAIN . $VHOST \" If the nginx-hostname plugin has no output, the normal hostname algorithm will be executed.

Dokku supports application configuration via environment variables. Environment variables may contain private data, such as passwords or API keys, so it is not recommended to store them in your application's repository. The config plugin provides the following commands to manage your variables: config (<app>|--global) Display all global or app-specific config vars config:get (<app>|--global) KEY Display a global or app-specific config value config:set (<app>|--global) KEY1=VALUE1 [KEY2=VALUE2 ...] Set one or more config vars config:unset (<app>|--global) KEY1 [KEY2 ...] Unset one or more config vars The variables are available both at run time and during the application build/compilation step for buildpack-based deploys. For security reasons - and as per docker recommendations - Dockerfile-based deploys have variables available only during runtime, as noted in this issue . For buildpack deploys, Dokku will create a /app/.env file that can be used for legacy buildpacks. Note that this is not updated when config:set or config:unset is called, and is only written during a deploy or ps:rebuild . Developers are encouraged to instead read from the application environment directly, as the proper values will be available then. Note Global ENV files are sourced before app-specific ENV files. This means that app-specific variables will take precedence over global variables. Configuring your global ENV file is manual, and should be considered potentially dangerous as configuration applies to all applications. You can set multiple environment variables at once: dokku config:set node-js-app ENV = prod COMPILE_ASSETS = 1 When setting variables with whitespaces, you need to escape them: dokku config:set node-js-app KEY = \\\" VAL \\ WITH \\ SPACES \\\" When setting or unsetting environment variables, you may wish to avoid an application restart. This is useful when developing plugins or when setting multiple environment variables in a scripted manner. To do so, use the --no-restart flag: dokku config:set --no-restart node-js-app ENV = prod If you wish to have the variables output in an eval -compatible form, you can use the --export flag: dokku config node-js-app --export # outputs variables in the form: # # export ENV='prod' # export COMPILE_ASSETS='1' # source in all the node-js-app app environment variables eval $( dokku config node-js-app --export ) You can also output the variables in a single-line for usage in command-line utilities with the --shell flag: dokku config node-js-app --shell # outputs variables in the form: # # ENV='prod' COMPILE_ASSETS='1'","title":"Environment Variables"},{"location":"configuration/environment-variables/#environment-variables","text":"Typically an application will require some configuration to run properly.

The config plugin provides the following commands to manage your variables: config (<app>|--global) Display all global or app-specific config vars config:get (<app>|--global) KEY Display a global or app-specific config value config:set (<app>|--global) KEY1=VALUE1 [KEY2=VALUE2 ...] Set one or more config vars config:unset (<app>|--global) KEY1 [KEY2 ...] Unset one or more config vars The variables are available both at run time and during the application build/compilation step for buildpack-based deploys. For security reasons - and as per docker recommendations - Dockerfile-based deploys have variables available only during runtime, as noted in this issue . For buildpack deploys, Dokku will create a /app/.env file that can be used for legacy buildpacks. Note that this is not updated when config:set or config:unset is called, and is only written during a deploy or ps:rebuild . Developers are encouraged to instead read from the application environment directly, as the proper values will be available then. Note Global ENV files are sourced before app-specific ENV files. This means that app-specific variables will take precedence over global variables. Configuring your global ENV file is manual, and should be considered potentially dangerous as configuration applies to all applications. You can set multiple environment variables at once: dokku config:set node-js-app ENV = prod COMPILE_ASSETS = 1 When setting variables with whitespaces, you need to escape them: dokku config:set node-js-app KEY = \\\" VAL \\ WITH \\ SPACES \\\" When setting or unsetting environment variables, you may wish to avoid an application restart. This is useful when developing plugins or when setting multiple environment variables in a scripted manner. To do so, use the --no-restart flag: dokku config:set --no-restart node-js-app ENV = prod If you wish to have the variables output in an eval -compatible form, you can use the --export flag: dokku config node-js-app --export # outputs variables in the form: # # export ENV='prod' # export COMPILE_ASSETS='1' # source in all the node-js-app app environment variables eval $( dokku config node-js-app --export ) You can also output the variables in a single-line for usage in command-line utilities with the --shell flag: dokku config node-js-app --shell # outputs variables in the form: # # ENV='prod' COMPILE_ASSETS='1'","title":"Environment Variables"},{"location":"configuration/nginx/","text":"Nginx Configuration Dokku uses nginx as its server for routing requests to specific applications.

This may cause issues for applications that use non-standard ports, as those may not be automatically detected. Please refer to the proxy documentation for information as to how to reconfigure the mappings. Per-application certificate management Dokku provides built-in support for managing SSL certificates on a per-application basis. SSL is managed via nginx outside of application containers, and as such can be updated on-the-fly without rebuilding containers. At this time, applications only support a single SSL certificate at a time. To support multiple domains for a single application, wildcard certificate usage is encouraged. Certificate setting The certs:add command can be used to push a tar containing a certificate .crt and .key file to a single application. The command should correctly handle cases where the .crt and .key are not named properly or are nested in a subdirectory of said tar file. You can import it as follows: tar cvf cert-key.tar server.crt server.key dokku certs:add node-js-app < cert-key.tar Note If your .crt file came alongside a .ca-bundle , you'll want to concatenate those into a single .crt file before adding it to the .tar . cat yourdomain_com.crt yourdomain_com.ca-bundle > server.crt SSL and Multiple Domains When an SSL certificate is associated to an application, the certificate will be associated with all domains currently associated with said application. Your certificate should be associated with all of those domains, otherwise accessing the application will result in SSL errors. If you wish to remove one of the domains from the application, refer to the domain configuration documentation . Note that with the default nginx template, requests will be redirected to the https version of the domain. If this is not the desired state of request resolution, you may customize the nginx template in use. For more details, see the nginx documentation . Certificate generation Note Using this method will create a self-signed certificate, which is only recommended for development or staging use, not production environments. The certs:generate command will walk you through the correct openssl commands to create a key, csr and a self-signed cert for a given app/domain. We automatically put the self-signed cert in place as well as add the specified domain to the application configuration. If you decide to obtain a CA signed certificate, you can import that certificate using the aforementioned dokku certs:add command. Certificate removal The certs:remove command only works on app-specific certificates. It will rm the app-specific tls directory, rebuild the nginx configuration, and reload nginx. Displaying certificate reports about an app New Introduced in 0.8.1 You can get a report about the apps ssl status using the certs:report command: Shell Output dokku certs:report =====> node-js-sample Ssl dir: /home/dokku/node-js-sample/tls Ssl enabled: true Ssl hostnames: *.node-js-sample.org node-js-sample.org Ssl expires at: Oct 5 23:59:59 2019 GMT Ssl issuer: C=GB, ST=Greater Manchester, L=Salford, O=COMODO CA Limited, CN=COMODO RSA Domain Validation Secure Server CA Ssl starts at: Oct 5 00:00:00 2016 GMT Ssl subject: OU=Domain Control Validated; OU=PositiveSSL Wildcard; CN=*.node-js-sample.org Ssl verified: self signed. =====> python-sample Ssl dir: /home/dokku/python-sample/tls Ssl enabled: false Ssl hostnames: Ssl expires at: Ssl issuer: Ssl starts at: Ssl subject: Ssl verified: You can run the command for a specific app also.

You can pass flags which will output only the value of the specific information you want. For example: dokku certs:report node-js-sample --ssl-enabled HSTS Header The HSTS header is an HTTP header that can inform browsers that all requests to a given site should be made via HTTPS. Dokku does not, by default, enable this header. It is thus left up to you, the user, to enable it for your site. Beware that if you enable the header and a subsequent deploy of your application results in an HTTP deploy (for whatever reason), the way the header works means that a browser will not attempt to request the HTTP version of your site if the HTTPS version fails. Running behind a load balancer Your application has access to the HTTP headers X-Forwarded-Proto , X-Forwarded-Port and X-Forwarded-For . These headers indicate the protocol of the original request (HTTP or HTTPS), the port number, and the IP address of the client making the request, respectively. The default configuration is for Nginx to set these headers. If your server runs behind an HTTP/S load balancer, then Nginx will see all requests as coming from the load balancer. If your load balancer sets the X-Forwarded- headers, you can tell Nginx to pass these headers from load balancer to your application by using the following nginx custom template server { listen [::]:{{ . NGINX_PORT }}; listen {{ . NGINX_PORT }}; server_name {{ . NOSSL_SERVER_NAME }}; access_log / var / log / nginx / {{ . APP }} - access . log ; error_log / var / log / nginx / {{ .

DOKKU_ROOT }} / {{ . APP }} / nginx . conf . d /* . conf ; } upstream {{ . APP }} { {{ range . DOKKU_APP_LISTENERS | split \" \" }} server {{ . }}; {{ end }} } Only use this option if: 1. All requests are terminated at the load balancer, and forwarded to Nginx 2. The load balancer is configured to send the X-Forwarded- headers (this may be off by default) If it's possible to make HTTP/S requests directly to Nginx, bypassing the load balancer, or if the load balancer is not configured to set these headers, then it becomes possible for a client to set these headers to arbitrary values. This could result in security issue, for example, if your application looks at the value of the X-Forwarded-Proto to determine if the request was made over HTTPS. SSL Port Exposure When your app is served from port 80 then the /home/dokku/APP/nginx.conf file will automatically be updated to instruct nginx to respond to ssl on port 443 as a new cert is added. If your app uses a non-standard port (perhaps you have a dockerfile deploy exposing port 99999 ) you may need to manually expose an ssl port via dokku proxy:ports-add <APP> https:443:99999 .","title":"SSL Configuration"},{"location":"configuration/ssl/#ssl-configuration","text":"New Introduced in 0.4.0 Dokku supports SSL/TLS certificate inspection and CSR/Self-signed certificate generation via the certs plugin.

Using run for cron tasks You can always use a one-off container to run an application task: dokku --rm run node-js-app some-command dokku --rm-container run node-js-app some-command For tasks that should not be interrupted, run is the preferred method of handling cron tasks, as the container will continue running even during a deploy or scaling event. The trade-off is that there will be an increase in memory usage if there are multiple concurrent tasks running. Entering existing containers New Introduced in 0.4.0 enter <app> [<container-type> || --container-id <container-id>] # Connect to a specific app container The enter command can be used to enter a running container. The following variations of the command exist: dokku enter node-js-app web dokku enter node-js-app web.1 dokku enter node-js-app --container-id ID Additionally, you can run enter with no container-type. If only a single container-type is defined in your app, you will be dropped into the only running container. This behavior is not supported when specifying a custom command; as described below. By default, it runs a /bin/bash , but can also be used to run a custom command: # just echo hi dokku enter node-js-app web echo hi # run a long-running command, as one might for a cron task dokku enter node-js-app web python script/background-worker.py Using enter for cron tasks Your procfile can have the following entry: cron : sleep infinity With the cron process scaled to 1 : dokku ps:scale node-js-app cron = 1 You can now run all your commands in that container: dokku enter node-js-app cron some-command Note that you can also run multiple commands at the same time to reduce memory usage, though that may result in polluting the container environment. For tasks that will properly resume, you should use the above method, as running tasks will be interrupted during deploys and scaling events, and subsequent commands will always run with the latest container. Note that if you scale the cron container down, this may interrupt proper running of the task. General Cron Recommendations Regularly scheduled tasks can be a bit of a pain with dokku. The following are general recommendations to follow to help ensure successful task runs. Use the dokku user's crontab If you do not, the dokku binary will attempt to execute with sudo dokku, and your cron run with fail with sudo: no tty present and no askpass program specified Add a MAILTO environment variable to ship cron emails to yourself. Add a PATH environment variable or specify the full path to binaries on the host. Add a SHELL environment variable to specify bash when running commands. Keep your cron tasks in time-sorted order. Keep your server time in UTC so you don't need to translate daylight saving's time when reading the cronfile. Run tasks at the lowest traffic times if possible. Use cron to trigger jobs, not run them. Use a real queuing system such as rabbitmq to actually process jobs. Try to keep tasks quiet so that mails only send on errors. Do not silence standard error or standard out. If you silence the former, you will miss failures. Silencing the latter means you should actually make application changes to handle log levels. Use a service such as Dead Man's Snitch to verify that cron tasks completed successfully. Add lots of comments to your cronfile, including what a task is doing, so that you don't spend time deciphering the file later. Place your cronfiles in a pattern such as /etc/cron.d/APP . Do not use non-ascii characters in your cronfile names. Cron is finicky. Remember to have trailing newlines in your cronfile! Cron is finicky.

Usage Listing processes running in an app container To find out if your application's containers are running the commands you expect, simply run the ps command against that application. dokku ps node-js-app Rebuilding applications There are some Dokku commands which will not automatically rebuild an application's environment, or which can be told to skip a rebuild. For instance, you may wish to run multiple config:set commands without a restart so as to speed up configuration. In these cases, you can ultimately trigger an application rebuild using ps:rebuild dokku ps:rebuild node-js-app You may also rebuild all applications at once, which is useful when enabling/disabling a plugin that modifies all applications: dokku ps:rebuildall Info The ps:rebuild and ps:rebuildall commands only work for applications for which there is a source, and thus will only always work deterministically for git-deployed application. Please see the images documentation and tar documentation in for more information concerning rebuilding those applications. Restarting applications Applications can be restarted, which is functionally identical to calling the release_and_deploy function on an application. Please not that any linked containers must be started before the application in order to have a successful boot. dokku ps:restart node-js-app You may also trigger a restart on all applications at one time: dokku ps:restartall ps:scale command Dokku can also manage scaling itself via the ps:scale command. This command can be used to scale multiple process types at the same time. dokku ps:scale node-js-app web = 1 Multiple process types can be scaled at once: dokku ps:scale node-js-app web = 1 worker = 1 Issuing the ps:scale command with no process type argument will output the current scaling settings for an application: Shell Output dokku ps:scale node-js-app -----> Scaling for node-js-app -----> proctype qty -----> -------- --- -----> web 1 -----> worker 1 Stopping applications Deployed applications can be stopped using the ps:stop command. This turns all running containers for an application, and will result in a 502 Bad Gateway response for the default nginx proxy implementation. dokku ps:stop node-js-app Starting applications All stopped containers can be started using the ps:start command. This is similar to running ps:restart , except no action will be taken if the application containers are running. dokku ps:start node-js-app Restart Policies New Introduced in 0.7.0 By default, Dokku will automatically restart containers that exit with a non-zero status up to 10 times via the on-failure Docker restart policy .

Dokku will also wait a further 60 seconds after the deploy is complete before terminating old containers in order to give time for long running connections to terminate. In either case, you may have more than one container running for a given application. You may both create user-defined checks for web processes using a CHECKS file, as well as customize any and all parts of this experience using the checks plugin. Configuring Check Settings using the config plugin There are certain settings that can be configured via environment variables: DOKKU_DEFAULT_CHECKS_WAIT : (default: 10 ) If no user-defined checks are specified - or if the process being checked is not a web process - this is the period of time Dokku will wait before checking that a container is still running. DOKKU_DOCKER_STOP_TIMEOUT : (default: 10 ) Configurable grace period given to the docker stop command. If a container has not stopped by this time, a kill -9 signal or equivalent is sent in order to force-terminate the container. Both the ps:stop and apps:destroy commands also respect this value. If not specified, the docker defaults for the docker stop command will be used. DOKKU_WAIT_TO_RETIRE : (default: 60 ) After a successful deploy, the grace period given to old containers before they are stopped/terminated. This is useful for ensuring completion of long-running http connections.

Checks are run against the detected web process from your application's Procfile . For non-web processes, Dokku will fallback to the aforementioned process uptime check. To specify checks, add a CHECKS file to the root of your project directory. The CHECKS file should be plain text and may contain: Check instructions Settings (NAME=VALUE) Comments (lines starting with #) Empty lines Info For dockerfile-based deploys, the file must be in /app/CHECKS within the container. /app is used by default as the root container directory for buildpack-based deploys. Check Instructions The format of a check instruction is a path or relative URL, optionally followed by the expected content: /about Our Amazing Team The CHECKS file can contain multiple checks: / My Amazing App /stylesheets/index.css .body /scripts/index.js $(function() /images/logo.png To check an application that supports multiple hostnames, use relative URLs that include the hostname: //admin.example.com Admin Dashboard //static.example.com/logo.png You can also specify the protocol to explicitly check HTTPS requests: https://admin.example.com Admin Dashboard https://static.example.com/logo.png While a full url may be used in order to invoke checks, if you are using relative urls, the port must be omitted. Check Settings The default behavior is to wait for 5 seconds before running the checks, to timeout the checks after 30 seconds, and to attempt the checks 5 times. If the checks fail 5 times, the deployment is considered failed and the old container will continue serving traffic. You can change the default behavior by setting WAIT , TIMEOUT , and ATTEMPTS to different values in the CHECKS file: WAIT=30 # Wait 1/2 minute TIMEOUT=60 # Timeout after a minute ATTEMPTS=10 # Attempt checks 10 times / My Amazing App Manually Invoking Checks Checks can also be manually invoked via the checks:run command.

The reason for the failure is that the postgres database connection fails. The initial checks will fail while we wait for the server to start up, just like in the above example. However, once the server does start accepting connections, we will see an error 500 due to the postgres database connection failure. Once the attempts have been exceeded, the deployment fails and we see the container output, which shows the Postgres connection errors.

To avoid this automatic Dockerfile deployment detection, you may do one of the following: Use dokku config:set to set the BUILDPACK_URL environment variable. Add BUILDPACK_URL to a committed .env file in the root of your repository. See the environment variable documentation for more details. Create a .buildpacks file in the root of your repository. Specifying a custom buildpack In certain cases you may want to specify a custom buildpack. While Dokku uses herokuish to support all the official heroku buildpacks , it is possible that the buildpack detection does not work well for your application. As well, you may wish to use a custom buildpack to handle specific application logic. To use a specific buildpack, you can run the following Dokku command: # replace REPOSITORY_URL with your buildpack's url dokku config:set node-js-app BUILDPACK_URL = REPOSITORY_URL # example: using a specific ruby buildpack version dokku config:set node-js-app BUILDPACK_URL = https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby.git#v142 Please check the documentation for your particular buildpack as you may need to include configuration files (such as a Procfile) in your project root. Using multiple buildpacks You can only set a single buildpack using the BUILDPACK_URL , though there may be times when you wish to use multiple buildpacks. To do so, simply create a .buildpacks file in the base of your repository. This file should list all the buildpacks, one-per-line. For instance, if you wish to use both the nodejs and ruby buildpacks, your .buildpacks file should contain the following: https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs.git#v87 https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby.git#v142 Info Always remember to pin your buildpack versions when using the multi-buildpacks method, or you may find deploys changing your deployed environment. You may also choose to set just a single buildpack in this file, though that is up to you. Please check the documentation for your particular buildpack(s) as you may need to include configuration files (such as a Procfile) in your project root. Using a specific buildpack version As Dokku pins all buildpacks via herokuish releases, there may be occasions where a local buildpack version is out of date. If you wish to use a more recent version of the buildpack, you may use any of the above methods to specify a buildpack without the git sha attached like so: # using the latest nodejs buildpack dokku config:set node-js-app BUILDPACK_URL = https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs You may also wish to use a specific version of a buildpack, which is also simple # using v87 of the nodejs buildpack dokku config:set node-js-app BUILDPACK_URL = https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs#v87 Specifying commands via Procfile While many buildpacks have a default command that is run when a detected repository is pushed, it is possible to override this command via a Procfile. A Procfile can also be used to specify multiple commands, each of which is subject to process scaling. See the process scaling documentation for more details around scaling individual processes. A Procfile is a file named Procfile . It should be named Procfile exactly, and not anything else. For example, Procfile.txt is not valid. The file should be a simple text file. The file must be placed in the root directory of your application. It will not function if placed in a subdirectory. If the file exists, it should not be empty, as doing so may result in a failed deploy. The syntax for declaring a Procfile is as follows. Note that the format is one process type per line, with no duplicate process types. <process type>: <command> If, for example, you have multiple queue workers and wish to scale them separately, the following would be a valid way to work around the requirement of not duplicating process types: worker : env QUEUE =* bundle exec rake resque : work importantworker : env QUEUE = important bundle exec rake resque : work The web process type holds some significance in that it is the only process type that is automatically scaled to 1 on the initial application deploy. See the process scaling documentation for more details around scaling individual processes. Curl Build Timeouts Certain buildpacks may time out in retrieving dependencies via curl. This can happen when your network connection is poor or if there is significant network congestion. You may see a message similar to gzip: stdin: unexpected end of file after a curl command. If you see output similar this when deploying , you may need to override the curl timeouts to increase the length of time allotted to those tasks.

Differences between the two systems will be documented here. To use a dockerfiles for deployment, commit a valid Dockerfile to the root of your repository and push the repository to your Dokku installation.

Exposed ports Info Changed as of 0.5.0 Dokku will extract all tcp ports exposed using the EXPOSE directive (one port per line) and setup nginx to proxy the same port numbers to listen publicly. If you would like to change the exposed port, you should do so within your Dockerfile and app. Note Nginx does not support proxying UDP. UDP ports can be exposed by disabling the nginx proxy with dokku proxy:disable myapp If you do not explicitly EXPOSE a port in your Dockerfile , Dokku will configure the nginx proxy to listen on port 80 (and 443 for TLS) and forward traffic to your app listening on port 5000 inside the container. Just like buildpack apps, you can also use the $PORT environment variable in your app to maintain portability. When ports are exposed through the default nginx proxy, they are proxied externally as HTTP ports. At this time, in no case do we proxy plain TCP or UDP ports. If you would like to investigate alternative proxy methods, please refer to our proxy management documentation . Customizing the run command By default no arguments are passed to docker run when deploying the container and the CMD or ENTRYPOINT defined in the Dockerfile are executed. You can take advantage of docker ability of overriding the CMD or passing parameters to your ENTRYPOINT setting $DOKKU_DOCKERFILE_START_CMD . Let's say for example you are deploying a base nodejs image, with the following ENTRYPOINT : ENTRYPOINT [ \"node\" ] You can do: dokku config:set node-js-app DOKKU_DOCKERFILE_START_CMD = \"--harmony server.js\" To tell docker what to run.

If this behavior is not desired, you can override that configuration variable with the config:set command. Example: dokku config:set test-app DOKKU_DOCKERFILE_PORTS=\"5984/tcp 80/tcp\" Deploying an image from CI To ensure your builds are always reproducible, it's considered bad practice to store build artifacts in your repository. For some projects however, building artifacts during deployment to Dokku may affect the performance of running applications. One solution is to build a finished Docker image on a CI service (or even locally) and deploy it directly to the host running dokku.

You can use any language you want, so long as the script: Is executable Has the proper language requirements installed For instance, if you wanted to write a plugin trigger in PHP, you would need to have php installed and available on the CLI prior to plugin trigger invocation. The following is an example for the nginx-hostname plugin trigger. It reverses the hostname that is provided to nginx during deploys. If you created an executable file named nginx-hostname with the following code in your plugin trigger, it would be invoked by Dokku during the normal app deployment process: #!/usr/bin/env bash set -eo pipefail ; [[ $DOKKU_TRACE ]] && set -x APP = \" $1 \" ; SUBDOMAIN = \" $2 \" ; VHOST = \" $3 \" NEW_SUBDOMAIN = ` echo $SUBDOMAIN | rev ` echo \" $NEW_SUBDOMAIN . $VHOST \" Available plugin triggers There are a number of plugin-related triggers.

As Dokku sometimes internally invokes the dokku command, special care should be taken to properly handle internal command redirects. Note that the trigger should exit as follows: 0 to continue running as normal 1 to halt execution of the command The SSH_USER is the original ssh user. If you are running remote commands, this user will typically be dokku , and as such should not be trusted when checking permissions. If you are connected via ssh as a different user who then invokes dokku , the value of this variable will be that user's name ( root , myuser , etc.). The SSH_NAME is the NAME variable set via the sshcommand acl-add command. If you have set a user via the dokku-installer , this value will be set to admin . For installs via debian package, this value may be default . For reference, the following command can be run as the root user to specify a specific NAME for a given ssh key: sshcommand acl-add dokku NAME < $PATH_TO_SSH_KEY Note that the NAME value is set at the first ssh key match. If an ssh key is set in the /home/dokku/.ssh/authorized_keys multiple times, the first match will decide the value.

If you are running remote commands, this user will typically be dokku , and as such should not be trusted when checking permissions. If you are connected via ssh as a different user who then invokes dokku , the value of this variable will be that user's name ( root , myuser , etc.). The SSH_NAME is the NAME variable set via the sshcommand acl-add command. If you have set a user via the dokku-installer , this value will be set to admin . For installs via debian package, this value may be default .

Then only those changes need to be pushed to the AUR repo and an updated version of the package is ready for usage for our ArchLinux users. For detailed information see the section below.

Dokku is an extensible, open source Platform as a Service that runs on a single server of your choice. To start using Dokku, you'll need a system that meets the following minimum requirements: A fresh installation of Ubuntu 16.04 x64 , Ubuntu 14.04 x64 , Debian 8.2 x64 or CentOS 7 x64 (experimental) with the FQDN set [1] At least 1GB of system memory [2] You can optionally have a domain name pointed at the host's IP, though this is not necessary. Dokku is designed for usage on a fresh VM installation, and should install all necessary dependencies if installing via the bootstrap method. Installing the latest stable version 1. Install dokku To install the latest stable version of dokku, you can run the following shell commands: # for debian systems, installs Dokku via apt-get wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dokku/dokku/v0.8.2/bootstrap.sh ; sudo DOKKU_TAG = v0.8.2 bash bootstrap.sh The installation process takes about 5-10 minutes, depending upon internet connection speed. 2. Setup SSH key and Virtualhost Settings Once the installation is complete, you can open a browser to setup your SSH key and virtualhost settings. Open your browser of choice and navigate to the host's IP address - or the domain you assigned to that IP previously - and configure Dokku via the web admin. Warning: If you don't complete setup via the web installer (even if you set up SSH keys and virtual hosts otherwise) your Dokku installation will remain vulnerable to anyone finding the setup page and inserting their key. Warning: Web installer is not available on CentOS and Arch Linux. You will need to configure SSH keys and virtual hosts using dokku command line interface. 3. Deploy your first application Once you save your settings, the web admin will self-terminate and you should be able to run or deploy to the Dokku installation.
