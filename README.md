# dokku docs site

A generated version of the docs

## Contributing

The docs in this repository are automatically generated from other repositories. To contribute changes, modify the code in the following repositories:

- blog: [blog repo](https://github.com/dokku/blog)
- docs: [dokku core repo](https://github.com/dokku/dokku)
- tutorials: [tutorials repo](https://github.com/dokku/tutorials)

Changes to those repositories will automatically regenerate the respective docs folder in CI and auto-deploy the updated files.

All folders with a prefix of `docs~v` are historically generated docs for older versions of Dokku, and are not editable.
